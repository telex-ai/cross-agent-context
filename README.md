# Cross-Agent Context System

> Enable distributed teams using different AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to share context and collaborate effectively.

## üéØ What Is This?

A version-controlled context layer that lets AI coding agents share knowledge across your team, regardless of which tool each developer uses.

**The Problem**: When your team uses different AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor), each agent starts fresh with no context. Knowledge gets lost between sessions. Decisions aren't preserved. Developers repeat explanations.

**The Solution**: A simple `.context/` directory in your repo containing:
- Project memory (what & how things work)
- Architecture decisions (why choices were made)
- Known issues (current problems and workarounds)
- Agent instructions (how to work on this project)

When agents read these files, they're instantly "caught up" with your team's collective knowledge.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Works with ANY agent** - Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, or future tools
- ‚úÖ **No special infrastructure** - Just markdown files in your repo
- ‚úÖ **Version controlled** - Context travels with your code
- ‚úÖ **15-minute setup** - Start using it today
- ‚úÖ **Scales naturally** - From 2 to 200 developers
- ‚úÖ **Progressive automation** - Start manual, automate as needed

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Copy the starter kit to your project

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/telex-ai/cross-agent-context.git

# Copy .context/ to your project
cp -r cross-agent-context/context-starter-kit/.context /path/to/your/project/

# Commit it
cd /path/to/your/project
git add .context/
git commit -m "Add cross-agent context system"
git push
```

### 2. Fill in your project details

Edit `.context/memory/project-memory.md`:

```markdown
# Project Memory: Your Project Name

## Quick Context (TL;DR)
We're building [what] for [who] because [why].

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React
```

### 3. Use it with your agent

**Claude Code:**
```
"Read all files in .context/ to understand the project"
```

**Copilot:**
```
"@workspace Review .context/ to understand the project"
```

**Cursor:**
```
"Read .context/ directory before we start"
```

That's it! Your agent now has context.

## üéØ Use Cases

### Perfect For

- ‚úÖ Distributed teams using multiple AI agents
- ‚úÖ Teams that lose knowledge between sessions
- ‚úÖ Projects with frequent "why did we..." questions
- ‚úÖ Onboarding new developers
- ‚úÖ Preserving architectural decisions

### Not Ideal For

- ‚ùå Teams not using AI agents
- ‚ùå Solo developers (unless working with future self)
- ‚ùå Short-term projects (<3 months)
- ‚ùå Teams that won't maintain documentation

## üí° How It Works

```
Developer pulls code ‚Üí Gets latest context
    ‚Üì
Agent reads .context/ ‚Üí Understands project
    ‚Üì
Developer + Agent work ‚Üí Learn something
    ‚Üì
Update .context/ files ‚Üí Document learning
    ‚Üì
Commit and push ‚Üí Share with team
    ‚Üì
Next developer benefits ‚Üí No re-explaining needed
```

## üéì Examples

### Before (Without Context)
```
Developer A: "Build authentication"
Agent: "How should I do it?"
Developer: *explains JWT, patterns, security*
Agent: *builds it*

[Knowledge lost when session ends]

Developer B: "Add password reset"
Agent: "How should I do it?"
Developer: *explains same things again* üòû
```

### After (With Context)
```
Developer A: "Build authentication"
Agent: *reads .context/* 
Agent: "I see you use JWT, bcrypt..."
*builds consistently*
*updates context with learnings*

[Knowledge preserved]

Developer B: "Add password reset"
Agent: *reads .context/*
Agent: "Following your JWT pattern..."
*no re-explaining needed* üéâ
```

## üîë Core Principles

1. **Context should be version-controlled** alongside code
2. **Start simple** - Don't try to document everything
3. **Focus on "why"** not "what" - Code shows what, context explains why
4. **Make it easy** - Low friction = consistent use
5. **Keep it current** - Stale context is worse than no context

## üåü Benefits

### For Developers
- Less time explaining to agents
- Better agent suggestions
- Fewer repeated mistakes
- Faster work sessions

### For Teams
- Knowledge preserved across sessions
- Consistent approaches regardless of agent
- Faster onboarding
- Better architectural continuity

### For Organizations
- Works with any agent tool
- No vendor lock-in
- Scales to hundreds of developers
- Knowledge retention despite turnover

## üìä ROI Example

**Small team (5 developers):**
- Setup: 2 hours
- Per session: 5 min update
- Saves per session: 20 min not explaining
- **Break-even: ~8 sessions**
- **Monthly savings: 40+ hours**
